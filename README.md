# Data-Science-with-Python

## About This Repository 
The repository compiles projects and assignments from my Data Science with Python course, which covered the following concepts: . After receiving this knowledge, I have been able to: 
1. Utilize validation techniques, such as cross-validation, in order to prevent overfitting. Overfitting occurs when a model learns the training data too well and fails to generalize to unseen data (i.e. outputs a lower testing accuracy). 
2. Create clear and informative data visualizations using tools like Matplotlib and Seaborn to effectively communicate insights from datasets. 
3. Approach complex problems systematically, formulate hypotheses, analyze data, and derive actionable insights to inform decision-making.
   
## Topics/Concepts Covered 
1. Introduction to Tools and Basics (Python and NumPy) 
2. Pandas (Series, Univariate time series, Data indexing and selection) 
3. DataFrames and Data Ingestion
4. Data Cleaning 
5. Data Wrangling (Data aggregation and transformations, Filtering data, Merging and joining datasets, Pivot tables, etc.) 
6. Data Visualization and Decision Trees (Seaborn, Creating line and scatter plots, etc.)
